# RoboCam

RoboCam is essentially a robotic arm that holds a camera. It allows the camera to be moved around and oriented in any way you want. The arm attaches to any other device, so for example if you are running a probe over skin RoboCam can take pictures of the skin as you do that. It is cheap, lightweight, and has useful peripherals like pattern projectors that assist in camera orientation.

This is part of my summer project for the MIT Complex Instrumentation Group.
